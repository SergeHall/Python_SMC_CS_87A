# Name : Siarhei Hancharou

# Description of program :
# You can set the diagonal length of the matrix yourself.
# If you choose the length of the matrix equal to 3, you play the classic
# game tik tak toe, with the option to choose the difficulty level 1 or 2.
# Level 1 - the computer randomly places 0.
# Level 2 - the program tries to win, at least make a draw.
# board - A two-dimensional list that is defined by the length of the diagonal.
# diagonal - The length of the diagonal, we set the value of the matrix
#   in which the player and the computer will play.Since the matrix is square,
#   the diagonal length is equal to the number of columns and rows.
# A Python tic-tac-toe game.

import random


# Brief introduction to the game. Print out once at the beginning to
# describe the game to the player.
